# nextbus_check
Simple code to check if a bus route is available and alert someone if it isn't

To use, you must first make your own 'email_addresses.txt' file
that stores valid email addresses to send the message to. One
address per line.

check_104.py:
I use this for checking to see if any estimates are available
for the University of Maryland metro shuttle. It has saved me
a few times from accidentally going to work when the bus isn't
running. This code should be easily modified for other purposes
though.
